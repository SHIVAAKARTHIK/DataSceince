    "- Abstraction:\n",
    "    - Functions provide an abstraction layer that hides the complex implementation details of a task\n",
    "- Code Organization:\n",
    "    - Functions allow you to logically group related tasks together.\n",
    "    - This improves the overall organization of your codebase and makes it easier to navigate and understand the program's structure.\n",
    "- Testing and Debugging:\n",
    "    - Smaller functions are generally easier to test and debug than large monolithic pieces of code\n",
    "    - We can write unit tests for individual functions to ensure they work correctly, which aids in catching errors early in the development process.\n",
    "- Code Efficiency:\n",
    "    - Functions can help optimize your code by avoiding redundant code\n",
    "    - This can lead to more efficient and faster-running programs.\n",
    "- Scalability:\n",
    "    - As your program grows, functions allow you to scale your codebase more easily. \n",
    "    - You can add new functionality by simply creating new functions, rather than modifying existing code.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: \n",
    "    - Functions allow you to encapsulate data and behavior, promoting better data management and reducing the risk of unintentional data modification.\n",
